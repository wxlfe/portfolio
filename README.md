# Portfolio - Nate Wolfe

This is my portfolio site, live at [wxlfe.dev](https://wxlfe.dev). If you're here, you're probably more interested in the portfolio itself and its architecture, so I'll lay that out here.

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using Next.js with TypeScript. I also used a component library called [NextUI](https://nextui.org), which is built on Styled Components.

## CMS

I used Sanity as the CMS for this site, using GROQ as the query language.
